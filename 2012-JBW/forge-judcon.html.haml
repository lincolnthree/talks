      %li So how do we choose?
      %li On the one hand, we have native with the advantages it offers, but an increased development burden

      %li Another "must have" for mobile apps is orientation detection.
      %li When we have more screen real estate available, we should use it!
      %li In this trivial example, we conditionally display table columns depending on the orientation of the device.

        &nbsp;
    %ul.notes
      %li We can easily achieve this with some simple CSS leveraging the max-width CSS 3 property
      %li When the with of the display is less than the value specified (480px) we hide any element wit the CSS class "landscape"
      %li We've also created the converse "portrait" css class, Although it tends to be less useful in practice.

    %ul.notes
      %li JSF is great, but it needs some help to be made "mobile ready"
      %li To create responsive applications, we want to make heavy use of AJAX and avoid full page loads.
      %li To achieve thos, we adopt a single page programming model, which unfortunately is not well supported by the JSF navigation system - at least not yet ;)
      %li
      %li JSF Components need to be made Touch "compatible".
      %li For instance as a rule-of-thumb the touchable area should be 1cm x 1cm.
      %li Fortunately achieving this is simply a matter of providing the right CSS skin
      %li
      %li Finally we want to achieve a mobile L&F.
      %li The responsibility here falls to us, the component providers
      %li We'll take a close look at the RichFaces mobile components shortly, but first let's see what we can do with "vanilla" JSF

    %ul.notes
      %li One key requirement is to have the ability to tailor the content to the viewing device
      %li We've seen earlier that we can use CSS techniques to tailor the display based on the screen size
      %li But this is a client-side technique and works after the content is delivered to the browser
      %li
      %li If we want to seamlessly provide both mobile and desktop applications, we need to know sooner:

    %ul.notes
      %li Fortunately this is possible by inspecting the "user-agent" string which is sent from the browser with the initial request.
      %li
        Here we can see a typical user agent, and can infer some significant details from it.  For instance:
        %ul
          %li The browser claims to be Mozilla compliant (a useless claim nowadays)
          %li The OS is 64-bit linux
          %li The browser is a webkit browser
      %li What's important here is that it's obvious from this user-agent string that this is a desktop browser, and not a mobile one.
      %li The server knows this from the time of the initial request and we can react accordingly

      %li Using this library from JSF is then remarkably easy.

      %li In fact, in our sample applications we take this one step further and make use of URL rewriting library called "ReWrite"
      %li Rewrite has UAgentInfo built in, and we can define a simple rule to redirect mobile requests to a mobile specific page
      %li The rule here can be interpreted as:
      %li "If the requested page is the index page,and the request comes from a mbile browser, then redirect the request to a mobile specific page"
      %li Rewrite works at the servlet level, before the request even gets to JSF.
      %li This makes it transparent from a JSF perspective.

      %li where we can have the mobil clients respond to server-side events
      %li Here we see some sample code demonstrating how simple the push component is to use
      %li On our facelet page, we place an a4j:push component addressing a particular topic
      %li then in our backing bean we use CDI to inject a pushEvent for the same topic
      %li finally we fire a message from the pushEven in our backing bean, and respond to that event on the client-side
      %li here we respond to the event with a javascript event listener, but we could equally-well trigger an ajax update
      %li I should also point out that CDI is not required, we also provide a non-CDI APi for working with the push component

      %li the key thing to keep in mind with slidfast is that it's designed to be light-weight
      %li Slidfast is just what's required to write your mobile app the way you want, without requiring one to adopt a whole framework
      %li This is in contrast with many of the other "hevy-wight" mobile frameworks we mentioned earlier

        Let's look closer at what the mobile facelet page looks like (Don't worry about the font-size, we'll zoom in)
      %li
        This is for a vanilla JSF application + our slidfast CSS and javascript resources (we'll look at RichFaces enhancements to this shortly)
        %ol
          %li We are looking at a facelet composite page that uses a specific mobile template (HTML 5 doctype, slidfast resources)
          %li
            Here we initialize the slidfast library, defining:
            %ul
              %li the initial/default page id,
              %li the name of a callback method we'll see shortly
              %li the id of the button we'll use for backward navigation
          %li the div with id "browser" is styled by slidfast to fill up the entire page
          %li
            the html 5 header tag is used to set the title bar accross the top of the page
            %ul
              %li here's where we put the back-button with the id we configured above
          %li notice we navigate using location hashes - we'll see below how slidfast uses the location hash to slide content in and out of the view
          %li here we see a series of div's with css class "page" - this is our single page programming model
      %li this is the juicy part, let's bring this up on a page on it's own

      %li We can see a number of div elements with the page CSS class, each with an additional stage-* class
      %li These are the page elements that slidfast slides in and out
      %li The page ID activated is the one who's id is set in the location hash
      %li so if I want to activate the "about" page, I have to set the location hash to "about"

        &nbsp;
    %ul.notes
      %li We can set the location hash directly using an html tag
      %li Or we can use a javascript listener on a component to set it
      %li either way, once the location hash is changed, slidfast will initiate the page transition
      %li A big advantage of using th location is hash is it supports backwards navigation - through our custom back button, or via the browser controls
      %li There is (at least!) one significant problem with the previous approach
      %li Can anyone guess what it is?
      %li The approach won't scale - we've front-loaded all our mobile pages
      %li We need an AJAX driven approach that loads pages as required, if we want to scale

      %li
        Here we see the javascript necessary to invoke an ajax update when we change the location hash
        %ol
          %li First we need somewhere to put the location hash so it can be submitted by the ajax request - we do this with a inputHidden element
          %li Here we define the "handleHashChange" listener we registered with slidfast during initialisation - this method will be called whenever slidfast detects a page change
          %li In that listener, we first grab a reference to our hidden input, and update it with the location hash value
          %li
            Next we create an options object we will pass along with the jsf ajax request
            %ul
              %li "execute" and "render are analagous to the same attributes in an f:ajax call
              %li with the onevent callback we trigger the slidfast page transition when the ajax call is successful
          %li Finally we invoke the jsf.ajax method to trigger the ajax call and associated page updates
      %li The value of the location hash gets stored in the "location" prooperty of the pageBean, and is used to specify what page to include in the dynamic ui:include

    %ul.notes
      %li We can simplify this by using the RichFaces a4j:jsFunction component
      %li Notice how we no longer need the hidden input, as the a4j:param component let's us update backing beans directly
      %li We still have the oncomplete callback that invokes the slidfast page transition
      %li This is what we "ship today", if you are writing mobile apps with the current RichFaces release, this is what we provide

    %ul.notes
      %li (The Sandbox is the richfaces skunkworks, where we try out our new ideas and components before landing them into our component set)
      %li here we have a pageChanger that encapsulates the above javascript, and also provides some additional added value
      %li by allowing other components to take over the ajax rendering, in which case the pageChanger component only invokes the slidfast transition

    %ul.notes
      %li Looking at the facelet again as a whole, we can see how the introduction of the slidfast components greatly simplifies the page
      %li The pageChanger component has replaced many lines of javascript
      %li
        The pageContainer and page components have replaced the generic div elements. This offers a number of advantages
        %ul
          %li The page component is a valid target for jsf ajax updates (so we don't need to wrap everything in an h:outputPanel)
          %li The use of CSS classes for imparting behaviour has been replaced with more meaningful attributes, like the "stage" attribute
      %li The result is a page that looks and codes more like JSF, and less like a HTML 5/javascript app

    %h2 Responsive layout
    %a{:href => "http://bootstrap-richfaces.rhcloud.com", :target =>"demo"}
      %img{:src => "assets/images/richfaces_bootstrap.png"}
    %ul.notes
      %li I'd like to wrap up this presentation with a look at another sandbox effort, where we are creating JSF components out of the twitter bootstrap CSS resources
      %li If you haven't yet heard of the RichFaces bootstrap project, be sure to check it out.
      %li Bootstrap provides a set of cross browser CSS and javascript resources you can use to build modern web applications
      %li I could do a whole presentation on bootstrap components and how they fit with JSF
      %li But the key point I want to raise here is the "Responsive Layout".  Components adjust and resize themselves as the display size changes
      %li let's take a look at a demo of this
      %li [demo the bootstrap responsive layout]
      %li Hopefully you can see hoe building RichFaces applications with these components will lend itself nicely to mobile development

  %h2 The end?
  %h3.fragment{:style => "margin-top: 160px"} The beginning - of your mobile adventure with RichFaces!
  %ul.notes
    %li We've seen how mobile web-apps are a necessity in today's market
    %li and how JSF and RichFaces can be effective means of providing these web apps, particularly if we are already invested in the technology
    %li While RichFaces isn't required for building mobile JSF applications,we can see how the process is simplified by the introduction of javascript encapsulating mobile-specific components
    %li Finally we had a peek into the future, to see how RichFaces is going to further empwer us to build mobile web apps.
